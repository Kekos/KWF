KWF is a web framework written in PHP and JavaScript (obviously the server part is PHP and the client part is JavaScript).

There is no documentation right now, besides from comments in the code. Hopefully I will try to write some soon.

The server needs PHP version 5.3 or newer. If you want nice URL:s you will have to enable mod_rewrite in Apache.
